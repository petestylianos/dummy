# dummy

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dummy is to teach ME how to create R packages.

## Installation


You can install dummy from  from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("petestylianos/dummy")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem with dummy:

It produces 10 random numbers from the standard normal distribution. Very serious stuff. 

```{r example}
library(dummy)
library(tibble)
library(magrittr)
dummy::random_numbers %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

More examples to come soon.
