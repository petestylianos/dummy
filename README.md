# dummy

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dummy is to teach ME how to create R packages.

## Installation

You can install dummy from from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("petestylianos/dummy")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem
with dummy:

It produces 10 random numbers from the standard normal distribution.
Very serious stuff.

``` r
library(dummy)
dummy::random_numbers
#>  [1] -0.52117113  0.12125222  1.25613208  0.62883932 -0.87529190  0.73412077
#>  [7] -0.49844003  0.00854915  0.61912947  0.63267304
```

More examples to come soon.
